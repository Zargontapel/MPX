***** ALWAYS CHECK THERE FOR UPDATED INFORMATION! *****


The following is my current schedule of my office hours:

Wednesday: 2:00 - 4:45

Thursday: 1:00 - 2:00

You are free to stop by my office at any time during these scheduled office hours. If these hours do not work for you or your group then send me an e-mail and we can work out a time that is suitable for everyone. Please note that these times are subject to change and any changes you will be notified immediately.

My office is located in 757 ESB, Desk 6. If I am not in my office during my office hours, I will be back as soon as I can.
